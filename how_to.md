You are tasked with designing and implementing a backend system for a bill aggregation service. This service allows users to link their accounts from multiple utility providers (e.g., electricity, water, internet) and view their bills in one place. The system should aggregate bills from different providers, calculate the total amount due, and provide insights into the user's spending.
Requirements
Scalable:
The service should be capable of handling increasing amounts of traffic and data growth over time. To achieve scalability:
Load balancing and horizontal scaling should be used.
Implement a microservices architecture to isolate components and ensure ease of scaling.
Integration with Third-Party Utility Providers:
The system must integrate with multiple utility providers via their external APIs, supporting various authentication methods and ensuring smooth data transfer.
Fault-Tolerant:
To maintain the service’s availability during API failures, implement:
Retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls.
Fallback methods (e.g., cache or simulate data).
Error notifications for system admins when critical failures occur.
Concurrency:
Handle multiple concurrent requests when fetching bills, especially when users link several accounts:
Rate limiting using tokens or Redis to prevent overloading third-party APIs and ensure the system doesn't hit API limits.
Asynchronous processing (e.g., goroutines) to fetch data in parallel and improve efficiency.
Database Schema Design:
The database schema must support:
User data (credentials, preferences).
Linked accounts from different providers.
Aggregated bills and billers.
Optimized queries for fetching and updating bills.
Provider API Handling:
Support slow or unavailable APIs from utility providers.
Periodic bill refreshes (e.g., daily/weekly) to ensure the latest data is available.
Handle missing or stale data by utilizing caching or retries.
Data Consistency:
Ensure that the data remains consistent during updates, deletions, and failures:
Implement transactional consistency for bill updates and deletions.
Consider eventual consistency for data retrieved from third-party providers.
Implement periodic updates to ensure up-to-date bill data.

Key Considerations for Implementation
Idiomatic Go Code:
Write clean, modular, and maintainable code by following Go best practices.
Leverage Go’s concurrency model effectively using goroutines and channels for asynchronous operations.
Handle errors explicitly, using Go’s standard error handling patterns.
Utilize Go's standard library wherever possible to ensure simplicity, speed, and maintainability.
Follow Go's conventions for readability and performance, such as naming conventions, and structuring code with clear separation of concerns.
Security:
Authentication and Authorization: Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure API endpoints. Implement OAuth2 for integrating third-party APIs.
Input Validation: Ensure robust validation and sanitization of inputs to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.
Unit Testing:
Implement robust unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components (e.g., billing calculations, account linking).
Use mocking frameworks to simulate third-party API failures and ensure the system behaves as expected under various scenarios.
Utilize containers to simulate interactions with the real database for more accurate testing and validation.
Integration Testing:
Perform integration tests to verify end-to-end workflows, ensuring seamless communication between system components (e.g., linking accounts, fetching bills).
Implement tests for edge cases, such as provider downtime or slow responses.
Containerization:
Use Docker for containerizing the application and its dependencies.
Documentation:
Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the system, including setup instructions, API documentation, and integration guidelines.
Use tools like Swagger or Postman for interactive API documentation.
Include example requests and responses, authentication details, and endpoint usage.


Expected API Endpoints
Link Utility Account
POST /accounts/link
Input: User ID, provider name, account credentials.
Fetch Aggregated Bills
GET /bills
Input: User ID.
Fetch Bills by Provider
GET /bills/{provider}
Input: User ID given by the provider + provider name.
Refresh Bills
POST /bills/refresh
Delete Linked Account
DELETE /accounts/{account_id}
Data Sources
External Server to Simulate Bill Providers: Use an external simulation server or mock API to simulate bill data from multiple utility providers. This server can support basic features like:
Providing different bill amounts and due dates for different utility providers.
Returning a variety of statuses (paid, unpaid, overdue) for bills.
Simulating API errors, timeouts, and slow responses for testing fault tolerance.
